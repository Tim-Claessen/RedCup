Review the codebase and ensure it follows ../coding/CODING_STANDARDS.md:

1. **Comments**: Remove obvious comments (explain WHAT), keep ones explaining WHY (business rules, design decisions, workarounds)
2. **Consistency**: TypeScript (no `any`), imports (grouped correctly), components (one pattern), file structure
3. **Naming**: camelCase variables/functions, PascalCase types, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants
4. **Best practices**: Remove `as` assertions, fix useEffect deps, remove debug console.log, extract repeated logic
5. **Cleanup**: Remove commented code, unused imports, trailing blank lines
6. **Branding**: Make sure any newly added UI components are in line with the branding guidelines.
7. **README**: The README file is updated to be concise and up to date

**Output**: Summary of changes, files modified.

**Rules**: Preserve all functionality. Prioritize consistency.
