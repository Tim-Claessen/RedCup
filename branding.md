- **Layout:** The 6-Cup Triangle sits centered _above_ the word SINK.
- **Spacing:** Distance between the bottom cup and the text top = **1C**.
- **Scale:** The text "SINK" should be optically wider than the cup triangle to act as a base.

### The Horizontal Lockup (Secondary)

_Best for: Website Headers, Nav Bars._

- **Layout:** The 6-Cup Triangle sits to the _left_ of the word SINK.
- **Spacing:** Distance between the rightmost cup and the "S" = **1.5C**.
